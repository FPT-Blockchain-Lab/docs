# Introduction

## About Consensys GoQuorum

Quorum is an open-source protocol layer that provides developers with the configurable projects needed to make blockchain applications successful.
With Quorum, you have access to all the necessary components to take a blockchain solution from concept to production.

GoQuorum is a fork of [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) and is updated in line with go-ethereum releases.

Key enhancements over go-ethereum:

- [Privacy](https://docs.goquorum.consensys.net/concepts/privacy/privacy/) - GoQuorum supports private transactions and private contracts through public/private state separation, and utilises peer-to-peer encrypted message exchanges (see [Tessera](https://github.com/consensys/tessera)) for directed transfer of private data to network participants
  GoQuorum includes the following changes to geth:
- [Alternative Consensus Mechanisms](https://docs.goquorum.consensys.net/concepts/consensus/overview/) - with no need for POW/POS in a permissioned network, GoQuorum instead offers multiple consensus mechanisms that are more appropriate for consortium chains:

  - [QBFT](https://docs.goquorum.consensys.net/configure-and-manage/configure/consensus-protocols/qbft) - Improved version of IBFT that is interoperable with Hyperledger Besu
  - [Istanbul BFT](https://docs.goquorum.consensys.net/configure-and-manage/configure/consensus-protocols/ibft) - a PBFT-inspired consensus algorithm with transaction finality, by AMIS.
  - [Clique POA Consensus](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/225) - a default POA consensus algorithm bundled with Go Ethereum.
  - [Raft-based Consensus](https://docs.goquorum.consensys.net/configure-and-manage/configure/consensus-protocols/raft/) - a consensus model for faster blocktimes, transaction finality, and on-demand block creation

### Architecture

## About Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)

The EEA is a global community of blockchain leaders, adopters, innovators, developers and businesses. Weâ€™re accelerating business Ethereum through professional and commercial support, advocacy and research, standards development and ecosystem trust services.

Key Takeaways:

- The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) "...is a member-led industry organization whose objective is to drive the use of Ethereum blockchain technology as an open standard to empower enterprises."
- The EEA's mission is to deliver an open, standards-based architecture and specification to accelerate the adoption of Enterprise Ethereum.
- The EEA provides its members a community and access to educational material and various technical and media resources.

### How the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) Works

The alliance aims to build, promote, and support Ethereum blockchain technology best practices, standards, and a reference architecture capable of handling real-world applications and usage.

Launched in 2015, Ethereum is a blockchain-based, decentralized software platform that enables smart contracts and Distributed Applications (dApps) to be built and run without downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party.

Ethereum is not just a platform but also a Turing complete programming language running on a blockchain that helps developers build and publish distributed applications.

## FPT Blockchain Lab

## FPT Blockchain Quorum

[FPT Blockchain Quorum](https://github.com/FPT-Blockchain-Lab/quorum#fpt-blockchain-quorum-is-an-ethereum-based-blockchain-fork-from-goquorum) is an Ethereum-based blockchain fork from GoQuorum.

Difference between FPT Blockchain Quorum and GoQuorum:

- Block time: 1 second
- Use empty block period feature to reduce storage usage
- Using QBFT consensus
- Pre-config networks for FPT Blockchain
- Default up to Berlin hardfork
- Default node type is all archive nodes (gcmode=archive syncmode=full)
