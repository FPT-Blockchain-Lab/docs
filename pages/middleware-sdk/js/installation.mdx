# Getting Started With Quorum Middleware

## Installation

There are few options on how to install Quorum Middleware into your project:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i quorum-middleware
```

## Add Quorum Middleware To Your project

Now, we need to add Quorum Middleware to our app:

```js
import Web3 from "web3";
import {
  LC,
  LCWrapper,
  Permission,
  PermissionWrapper,
} from "quorum-middleware";
```

## Initialize Quorum Middleware

Finally, we need to initialize Quorum Middleware in JS. You can initialize Quorum Middleware by using default config or custom config:

### Default config

```js
const web3 = new Web3("http://localhost:8545");
const lc = new LC(web3);
const lcWrapper = new LCWrapper(web3);
const permission = new Permission(web3);
const permissionWrapper = new PermissionWrapper(web3);
```

### Custom config

```js
const web3 = new Web3("http://localhost:8545");

// Replace contract address to example address
// 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 -> example address
const customConfig = {
  lCContractAddresses: {
    LCManagement: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    Mode: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",

  },
  permissionContractAddresses: {
    OrgManager: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    AccountManager: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",

    RoleManager: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    VoterManager: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  },
  chainId: 6788,
  chainName: "FPT Quorum Testnet FIS Gateway",
  url: "http://localhost:8545",
};

const lc = new LC(web3, customConfig);
const lcWrapper = new LCWrapper(web3, customConfig);
const permission = new Permission(web3, customConfig);
const permissionWrapper = new PermissionWrapper(web3, customConfig);
```
