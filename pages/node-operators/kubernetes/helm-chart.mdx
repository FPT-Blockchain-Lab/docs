## Helm Charts Repo Usage

To utilize the Helm charts, [Helm](https://helm.sh) must first be installed. Refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) for installation guidelines.

### Adding the Repository
Once Helm is set up, add the repository with the following command:
    ```
    helm repo add fpt-blc-lab https://fpt-blockchain-lab.github.io/helm-charts
    ```

### Updating the Repository
If you have previously added this repo, update it to get the latest package versions:
    helm repo update
You can then view the available charts with:
    ```
    helm search repo fpt-blc-lab
    ```

### Installing a Chart
To install a specific chart, use:
    ```
    helm install my-<chart-name> fpt-blc-lab/<chart-name>
    ```

### Uninstalling a Chart
To remove an installed chart, execute:
    ```
    helm delete my-<chart-name>
    ```
