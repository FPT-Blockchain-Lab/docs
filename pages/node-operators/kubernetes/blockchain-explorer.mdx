### Blockchain Explorer

#### Blockscout

Blockscout serves as a blockchain explorer and utilizes a subchart of PostgreSQL. The default configuration for this subchart is specified in the `helm/charts/blockscout/values.yaml` under the PostgreSQL section.

To set up Blockscout for use with GoQuorum, follow these steps:

1. **Updating Helm Dependencies**:
   Update the Helm dependencies for Blockscout to ensure all necessary components are in sync.


2. **Deploying Blockscout**:
    Deploy the Blockscout chart to the designated namespace (`quorum`) and specify the values file tailored for GoQuorum.

This process sets up Blockscout as a blockchain explorer in your Quorum environment, leveraging PostgreSQL as its underlying database.
